# Feed-Forward Network

## Definition
A Feed-Forward Network (FFN) is a fundamental neural network architecture where information flows in one direction, from input to output layers, through one or more hidden layers, without any cycles or loops. Each neuron in a layer is connected to all neurons in the subsequent layer, but there are no connections between neurons in the same layer or backwards connections. FFNs are also known as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and form basic building blocks in more complex architectures like transformers.
