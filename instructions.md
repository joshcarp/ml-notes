Your task is to help convert Notion pages into a Jupyter Book documentation site. Follow these steps for each page:

1. First, identify the page type:
   - Paper Notes (scholarly articles and research papers)
   - Glossary (technical terms and definitions)
   - Projects (code projects, implementations, demos)

2. For each page type, create markdown files in these directories:
   - Paper Notes -> paper-notes/
   - Glossary -> glossary/
   - Projects -> projects/

3. File naming conventions:
   - Use kebab-case for filenames (convert spaces to hyphens, lowercase)
   - Example: "Attention Is All You Need" -> attention-is-all-you-need.md
   - Use the page's slug property if available, otherwise generate from title

4. Content structure for each type:

Paper Notes:
# [Paper Title]

## Overview
[Description]

## Links
- [Paper](DOI or URL)
- Tags: [comma-separated tags]

## Notes
[Content from Notion blocks]

Glossary:

# [Term]

## Definition
[Description]

## Tags
[comma-separated tags]

## Additional Notes
[Content from Notion blocks]

Projects:

# [Project Title]

## Overview
[Description]

## Links
[Project URL if available]

[Content from Notion blocks]

Block conversion rules:

Convert Notion paragraphs to plain text
Convert Notion headings to markdown headings (##, ###)
Convert Notion bullet points to markdown bullet points (-)


Special handling:

For Projects with Jupyter notebooks:

Place .ipynb files in the projects directory
Link to them in the markdown documentation


For Papers with DOIs:

For arXiv links, format as: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.[ID]
For other DOIs, use as-is


Only process pages where the 'publish' property is true

Create index files (index.md) in each directory with tables listing the content:

# [Section] Overview

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Title
  - Tags
  - Links

Please process my Notion pages according to these rules and provide the markdown output in the appropriate format.
