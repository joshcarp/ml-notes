This was done by Hinton and co and was what lead to the AI era of the 80s. Before this paper Multi-layer-perceptrons (MLPs) weren’t very common because they were very, very difficult to train.</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385" rel="noreferrer">**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition</a>** - The introduction of residuals (also known as skip connections) allowed for deeper networks. Before this paper the depth of a neural network was limited because it would diverge enough and back propagation was really, really difficult to do because of vanishing gradients. Residuals essentially have a “short circuit” past a block which allows for gradients to flow backwards through back propagation to earlier components without needing to go through intermediate layers. This greatly speeds up convergence.</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450" rel="noreferrer">**Layer Normalization</a> -** Layernorm happens in each layer to make sure that the values don’t explode and is applied at each layers output activations. It makes the surface more regular so that it’s more symmetrical and easier to optimize over. This means that weight updates can take the same increment step in all directions and not need to worry about overstepping in one dimension but under-stepping in another, and the outputs of the activations will be more regular so that the inputs to the activation functions are all within the same order of magnitude - for example one input to a neuron being 0.00001 and another one being 1,000,000 would cause a lot of problems for floating point rounding and quantization, for example.</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415v5" rel="noreferrer">**Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)</a> -** Activation function ****that leaves positive values unchanged but maps negative numbers to near zero.
