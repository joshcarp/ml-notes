    "- [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) - This is binary floating point. The specification gives good details about what types of errors that can accumulate which would impact training and interence, as well as possible optimisations that can be used, like fused-multiply-add (FMA), which can reduce intermediate errors. CPUs usually use FP32, GPUs FP16.\n",
    "- [BLAS](https://netlib.org/blas/) - Speed up matrix multiplication on CPUs.\n",
    "- [**Layer Normalization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) - Layernorm was introduced in this paper.\n",
    "- [**Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) - The introduction of residuals allowed for deeper networks. Before this paper the depth of a neural network was limited because it would diverge enough and back propagation was really, really difficult to do because of vanishing gradients. Residuals essentially have a “short circuit” past a block which limits how much the neural networks can influence.\n",
    "- [**Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415v5) - Activation function that leaves positive values unchanged but maps negative numbers to near zero. Other architectures use different activation functions. For example, OpenElm uses SwiGLU.\n",
    "- [**Learning representations by back-propagating errors**](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/naturebp.pdf) - Back-propagation was introduced here, couldn’t find the original paper. This was done by Hinton and co and was what lead to the AI era of the 80s.\n",
    "- [**Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) - Introduced the Adam optimiser.\n",
    "- [**DECOUPLED WEIGHT DECAY REGULARIZATION**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101) - Introduces AdamW optimiser used in the first transformer. Adam with weight where weight increases as time goes on.\n",

    "You Need**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02150) - People always point to the original Attention is all you need paper or the GPT paper that introduced the *decoder only* model, but this one was the first one that actually used it in practice.\n",
    "- [**Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners**](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) - This is the GPT-2 paper\n",
    "- [**Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training**](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) -** This paper introduced the “GPT” which was a breakthrough at the time. It introduced the idea of using next token prediction as a way to do self-supervised learning, which meant that we can put all of the internet into it and with a simple loss function over the vocabulary adjust the weights via backpropagation.\n",
    "- [**Attention Is All You Need**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762v7) - The OG introduced the idea of self-attention and the encoder/decoder architecture for language translation tasks (the encoder later got dropped because it was only used for translation). Another breakthrough from this paper was the training; “The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelisation and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.” - This fact here was what let it: overtake RNNs (which weren’t parallelisable), and lead NVIDIA to be worth more than 2.7 Trillion token credits."
