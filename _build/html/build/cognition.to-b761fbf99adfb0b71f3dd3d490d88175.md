[CognitionTO](https://cognition.to) is a community in Toronto dedicated to learning about the world.

Throughout history, there has been a trend of technology being incomprehensibly efficient at transforming people's lives. We often hope this transformation is positive, and the reduction of abject poverty, infant mortality, illiteracy, and wartime casualties has been a hallmark of technological progress. Yet, in the wake of this progress, we often find ourselves plagued with new classes of problems that mock us for the simplicity we once assumed of the world: financial instability, political polarization, the loneliness epidemic, and social media addiction end up exploding with the complexity that the world encapsulates today.

The goal of [CognitionTO](https://cognition.to) is to be a place for discussion, debate, and discovery of these complexities, with the hope that if we all know a little bit more about the world, then maybe we can work together to make it better.

Currently, [CognitionTO](https://cognition.to) hosts Machine Learning and AI paper readings every Monday, with plans to expand into other fields.
